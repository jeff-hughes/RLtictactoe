# Tic Tac Toe with Reinforcement Learning

Tic tac toe is an ancient game of skill and cunning, and even the most powerful supercomputers still cannot yet achieve the performance of the average eight-year-old child. This is my attempt to build on these efforts in the hope of achieving sentient general artificial intelligence.

Okay, really, it's just a way for me to play around with reinforcement learning a little bit. The code is loosely based on [this similar project](https://github.com/giladariel/TicTacToe_RL), but I didn't quite like how they had things set up, so I mostly rolled my own.

To play, clone the repo and run:

```
python main.python
```

It will prompt you with details about how you wish to proceed. You can pit two computer players against each other to train them, or play against the computer yourself in a head-to-head battle of wits. After a training session, you can save the detailed summary of who won each game to a text file, if so desired.
